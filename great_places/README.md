# great_places

Create a simple smartphone app that allows users to add great places. The app uses native device features like *camera*, *maps*, *location*, and *local storage SQLite database*. The app also uses an *image picker* to let users select any images taken by the camera, and then saves that image on the *Filesystem* (on the devive), and later on that image is reused to display on the places list and place detail screens.
